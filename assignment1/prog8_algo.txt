Here's the algorithm for the given C program, which calculates the sum of elements in a matrix where each element is defined as `mat[i][j] = floor((i+1)/(j+1))`:

1. Function arraySum(arr, row, col):
   a. Initialize a variable sum to 0.
   b. Iterate over the elements of the 2D array arr with 'row' rows and 'col' columns using nested loops:
      i. Add arr[i][j] to the sum.
   c. Return the sum.

2. Main function:
   a. Declare variables arr (a pointer to a pointer), row, col, i, j.
   b. Read the size 'row' from the user. Set col to the same value.
   c. Allocate memory for the 2D array 'arr' with 'row' rows and 'col' columns.
   d. Initialize the matrix elements using the formula `mat[i][j] = floor((i + 1) / (j + 1))` for 0 <= i < row and 0 <= j < col.
   e. Calculate the sum of all matrix elements using the arraySum function.
   f. Print the sum of the array elements.
   g. Free the memory allocated for 'arr'.
   h. End of the program.

3. End of the program.

The time complexity of the program is as follows:
- Memory allocation: O(row * col)
- Initializing matrix elements: O(row * col)
- Calculating the sum of all elements: O(row * col)
- Printing the result: O(1)
So, the overall time complexity of the program is approximately O(row * col).
