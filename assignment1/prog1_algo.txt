The code you provided is for finding the K-th largest sum of subarrays of an input array. Here's a step-by-step algorithm for the code:

1. Import necessary libraries: Include the standard input/output and standard library header files.

2. Define a merge function:
   - Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

3. Define a MergeSort function:
   - Recursively split the array into smaller subarrays until each subarray contains only one element.
   - Merge the subarrays while sorting them in the process.

4. Define a printArray function:
   - Print the elements of an array.

5. Define an arraySum function:
   - Calculate the sum of elements in an array and return it.

6. In the main function:
   - Declare necessary variables and dynamic memory arrays for input.
   - Read the size of the array (n) from the user.
   - Allocate memory for the input array and another array (arr2) to store all possible sums.
   - Read the elements of the array from the user.
   - Calculate the sum of all elements in the input array (arrSum).
   - Initialize variables for looping and sum calculations.
   - Calculate all possible sums of subarrays and store them in arr2.
   - Sort the arr2 array using the MergeSort function.
   - Read the value of K (K-th largest) from the user.
   - Print the K-th largest sum from the sorted arr2 array.

The time complexity of the program is as follows:
- Memory allocation and input reading: O(n)
- Sum calculation and storing in arr2: O(n^3)
- Sorting arr2 using MergeSort: O(n log n)
- Printing the K-th largest sum: O(1)

So, the overall time complexity of the program is O(n^3) due to the nested loops for calculating all possible sums.
