Here's the algorithm for the given C program, which checks if the sum of the i-th row is equal to the sum of the i-th column in a matrix:

1. Function printArray(arr, row, col):
   a. Iterate over the elements of the 2D array arr with 'row' rows and 'col' columns:
      i. Print arr[i][j] followed by a tab character
      ii. After each row, print a newline character to move to the next row
   b. End the function

2. Function rowSum(arr, row, col, i):
   a. Initialize a variable sum to 0.
   b. Iterate over each element in the i-th row of the matrix:
      i. Add the element to the sum.
   c. Return the sum.

3. Function colSum(arr, row, col, i):
   a. Initialize a variable sum to 0.
   b. Iterate over each element in the i-th column of the matrix:
      i. Add the element to the sum.
   c. Return the sum.

4. Main function:
   a. Declare variables arr (a pointer to a pointer), row, col, i, j.
   b. Read the number of rows 'row' and columns 'col' from the user.
   c. Allocate memory for the 2D array 'arr' with 'row' rows and 'col' columns.
   d. Read the elements of the matrix into 'arr'.
   e. Read the value of 'i' (which represents the i-th row/column to check).
   f. Decrement 'i' by 1 to adjust for 0-based indexing.
   g. Calculate the sum of the i-th row using rowSum.
   h. Calculate the sum of the i-th column using colSum.
   i. If the sums of the i-th row and i-th column are equal:
      - Print "Yes" and the sums.
   j. If the sums are not equal:
      - Print "No" and the sums.
   k. Free the memory allocated for 'arr'.
   l. End of the program.

5. End of the program.

The time complexity of the program is as follows:
- Memory allocation: O(row * col)
- Reading elements into the array: O(row * col)
- Calculating row sum: O(col)
- Calculating column sum: O(row)
- Printing the result: O(1)
So, the overall time complexity of the program is dominated by the row and column sum calculations, making it approximately O(row + col).
